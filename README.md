# 2D-Platformer
NEA for Jacsen Lai
Project outline:

A 2D platformer where players control a character with teleportation mechanics. The player can mark a location at any time by pressing a button. Pressing the button again instantly warps them back to the marked point.

There will be a marker system where there will be a button the player can press at any point to place a marker at their current position. Once you press the button again, you will be teleported back to that original position. Your momentum will be kept once you teleport, which can be used for speed boosts. 

There will be 10 levels which increase in difficulty. The levels will have platforms which will potentially move. The last few levels will include complex, multi step teleport puzzles which will require strategic marker placements in order to pass the level. 

The character will be a stickman figure which will have animations for movement. The character will be able to switch between sprinting and walking and the player can reset the level.

Enemies:

I will add enemies which will attack the player by using melee attacks and ranged attacks. There will be different types of enemies, which will have different abilities. These include shooting and swinging at the player, to which the player being hit will cause his health to reduce. The characterâ€™s HP will be set at 100, and each hit will vary depending on what difficulty the player chooses. Easy difficulty will deal 5 damage, Medium difficulty will deal 10 damage, Hard difficulty will deal 20 damage, and Impossible difficulty will deal 100 damage.
